# Colorize
Simple demonstration of a colorizing JavaScript function.

This function accepts a list of CSS colors and randomly colors letters of a sample string of text, with the added condition that no consecutive characters (excluding whitespace) will have the same color.


To run, clone the repository and just open index.html.
